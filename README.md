# auto-pilot-rc-car

I tried but failed to manage to control the DC motor and servo motor equipped in the RC car and finished the project.
I presume the problem is intrinsic in the incompatibility between the transmission module and the two motors.

Programmed client-side socket for sending frames of webcam put on the RC car, exploited Boost asynchronous library.

The Python code snippets are executed on the Raspbian OS of Raspberry Pi board and its GPIO pins are connected with the transmission module.
